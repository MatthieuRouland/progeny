#' Calculate PROGENy pathway scores from gene expression
#'
#' This function uses the linear model of pathway-responsive genes underlying
#' the PROGENy method. It transforms a gene expression matrix with HGNC gene
#' symbols in rows and sample names in columns into a pathway score matrix with
#' samples and in rows and pathways in columns.
